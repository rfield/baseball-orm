# Experiments with ORM / Protobuf using Golang
Object-relational mapping using Golang, protobuf, protoc-gen-gorm, etc

## To Do
- Set up a more standard (Maui-like) directory structure and do go mod init, etc
- Make a simple working player and team gRPC service (just Get)
- Make a simple database
- Try to follow the protoc-gen-gorm conventions for CRUD services to minimize code
- Try different object relationships - has many, etc
- Add custom db method
- Try w/ Spanner
- Try w/ go_spnr library (ORM for spanner)
